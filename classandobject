# 1.overriding
In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or 
child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

# 2.overloading
In Java, two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters. These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading.

# 3. static before method
Static is a keyword. The role of adding static before any entity is to make that entity a class entity.
 It means that adding static before methods and variables make them class methods and class variables

# 4. Define Abstraction
In Java, Data Abstraction is defined as the process of reducing the object to its essence so that only
 the necessary characteristics are exposed to the users.

# 5. What is garbage
Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
 Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short.

# 6. What is wrapper class
The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.

# 7.Difference between String builder and string
  StringBuffer
    1.StringBuffer is  thread safe.
    2.StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
    3.StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0

  String builder
    1.StringBuilder is  not thread safe. 
    2.StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuffer.
    3.StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.5

# 8.primitive object
  The language defines eight Java primitive data types: boolean, float, double, byte, short, int, long and char.

# 9. Define Class and Object
  Class
    A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

  Objects
    An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

# 10.What is final class
  The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being subclassed.
